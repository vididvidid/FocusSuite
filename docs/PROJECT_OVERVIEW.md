# FocusSuite - Complete Project Overview

*A comprehensive guide for understanding your productivity application*

---

## 🎯 What is FocusSuite?

FocusSuite is your intelligent desktop productivity application that combines AI-powered distraction blocking with automated video editing. Think of it as having a digital assistant that:

1. **Watches your screen** and hides distracting content in real-time
2. **Edits videos automatically** by blurring specific objects based on your descriptions

### The Problem It Solves
- **Information Overload**: Too many distractions on modern screens (news, ads, social media)
- **Focus Fragmentation**: Constant interruptions breaking deep work sessions
- **Manual Video Editing**: Time-consuming process of blurring sensitive content in videos

### Your Solution
- **Real-time AI filtering** of on-screen distractions
- **Intelligent context awareness** - only blocks what's irrelevant to your current focus
- **Automated video processing** with simple natural language prompts

## 🏗️ How Your Application Works

### Core Architecture Philosophy
Your application follows a **clean, modular design** with strict separation of concerns:

```
🧠 Core Logic (Business Rules)
    ↕️ Callbacks & Events
🎨 User Interface (Tkinter)
    ↕️ API Calls
🌐 External Services (OpenAI, Vision APIs)
```

### The Two Main Features

#### 1. Focus Monitor (Real-time Distraction Blocking)
```
User starts monitoring → Screenshots taken → OCR text extraction → 
AI analysis → Distraction detection → Overlay blur rectangles
```

**Smart Detection Process:**
- Uses **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** to detect screen changes efficiently
- Only analyzes when something actually changes (saves CPU and API calls)
- **Tesseract OCR** extracts all visible text
- **OpenAI GPT-4** or local LLM determines what's distracting based on your focus topic
- **Transparent overlay** appears with blur rectangles over distracting content

#### 2. Focus Video (Automated Video Editing)
```
User selects video + prompt → Extract unique frames → 
AI frame analysis → Generate blur timeline → Reconstruct video
```

**Flicker-Free Processing:**
- Extracts only **unique frames** using SSIM comparison (reduces processing time)
- **Parallel AI analysis** of selected frames for efficiency
- Creates a **definitive blur timeline** to prevent flickering
- **Reconstructs video** with smooth, consistent blurring
- **Preserves original audio** perfectly

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Your Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **UI Framework** | Tkinter + ttk | Native, lightweight desktop interface |
| **AI/LLM** | OpenAI GPT-4o | Text analysis and decision making |
| **Computer Vision** | OpenCV | Video processing and frame analysis |
| **OCR Engine** | Tesseract | Text extraction from screenshots |
| **Image Processing** | Pillow, scikit-image | Screenshot handling and analysis |
| **Video Editing** | MoviePy | Audio preservation and final assembly |
| **System Integration** | pystray, keyboard, pywin32 | System tray, hotkeys, Windows APIs |

### Key Code Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Manager Pattern
Each major feature has a dedicated manager:
```python
class FocusMonitorManager:
    - Handles screen monitoring lifecycle
    - Manages monitoring thread
    - Coordinates with overlay system

class VideoFeatureManager:
    - Orchestrates video processing workflow
    - Manages UI updates and progress
    - Delegates to VideoProcessor for heavy lifting
```

#### 2. Callback-Driven UI
Your core logic is completely separated from the UI:
```python
ui_callbacks = {
    'on_start': self._handle_monitoring_start,
    'on_stop': self._handle_monitoring_stop,
    'show_message': self._display_user_message,
    'update_progress': self._update_progress_bar
}
```

**Benefits:**
- UI can be completely replaced without touching core logic
- Easier testing of business logic
- Clean separation of presentation and logic

#### 3. Configuration Management
Centralized, persistent settings:
```python
class ConfigManager:
    - JSON-based settings storage
    - Automatic loading and saving
    - Default value handling
    - Thread-safe operations
```

### Performance Optimizations You've Implemented

#### 1. Efficient Screen Change Detection
```python
# Only process when screen actually changes
score, _ = ssim(last_screenshot_gray, current_screenshot_gray, full=True)
if score > 0.98:  # 98% similar = no significant change
    continue  # Skip expensive OCR and AI analysis
```

#### 2. Smart Frame Extraction for Videos
```python
# Extract only unique frames to reduce AI API calls
if last_frame_gray is not None:
    score, _ = ssim(last_frame_gray, current_frame_gray, full=True)
    if score > SSIM_THRESHOLD:
        continue  # Skip similar frames
```

#### 3. Parallel Processing
- Video frames analyzed in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Background monitoring thread doesn't block UI
- Asynchronous API calls with retry logic

## ⚙️ Configuration System

### Settings Storage
Your app uses JSON-based configuration:
```json
{
    "api_key": "sk-...",
    "worker_url": "http://localhost:8000",
    "last_focus_topic": "writing my report",
    "theme": "scholarly_light",
    "whitelist": ["notepad.exe", "vscode.exe"]
}
```

### Key Settings Explained

| Setting | Purpose | Example |
